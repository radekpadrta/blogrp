Hi there, and welcome to my blog! I’m Radek Padrta, and I’m excited to have you here.


# About me
I am a Cloud/DevOps Engineer. I started my IT journey in IT support, and after a few years, I jumped to the consultancy world, where I began working with Cloud technology and immediately fell in love with it.

Outside of work, I like to study about my field, read manga, hit the gym or spend quality time with friends and family.

I also want to mention my two helpers who assist me with everything I do when I am at home: our cats, Jojo and Buba:)

## About This Website
This blog is personal space where I’ll be documenting and sharing my thoughts and experiences. Whether you’re here to learn, get inspired, or just enjoy some engaging content, I hope you’ll find something valuable and interesting.

### Writing
I believe that sharing my thoughts and the things I'm working on will help me relax and improve my discipline. Why relax? In recent months, when I implemented my note-taking system and started writing about my days, I noticed that writing has a positive effect on me. Instead of overthinking, I simply write down my thoughts and leave them in the system, then I can access them if needed. This practice allows me to organize my ideas better and also reflect on my progress.

My mission is to share two posts per month and reflect on personal growth, Cloud/DevOps and learnings.
