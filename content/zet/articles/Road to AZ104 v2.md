How is it going with [Road to AZ104](https://www.radekpadrta.cz/zet/articles/road-to-az104/)?

---

At the start, I felt a lot of energy. I make at least one test every day, which takes approximately 1-2 hours.

I tested myself on Cloud Guru, Azure Learning, and I am newly testing myself on Examtopics, which was suggested by my colleague. There are actual questions from the exam, but I think the approach to memorizing them... there is soo much question, I dont have brain for it:)

Need to say I got a more than 70% only a few times...

In the meantime, I watched John Savill's [Networking Master Class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DuTWSvsLXM&t=3711s&ab_channel=JohnSavill%27sTechnicalTraining). Networking is a part that I am not strong in, so I am trying to work on it.

I also started watching [Azure 104 Study Cram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Knf9nub4-k&t=3275s&ab_channel=JohnSavill%27sTechnicalTraining) from John Savill, which I think gave me a lot. I want to watch it one more time.

I need to mention, I don't take many notes. I take notes only if I fail on some questions, but I do not take notes through the videos. This can be a problem, but I need to think positively before the test. After the fight, we can try a different way.

The plan is to focus mainly next week on the exam and check the Study Cram one more time. And then take action! 

Let's see if we can make it :)
