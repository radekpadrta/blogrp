We are pushing our Home Business in these last days.

One of the things we need is an e-shop, and this is the task I’m taking care of. I was deciding between two e-commerce platforms. It was between Tilda and Shopify. The winner is Shopify, and it was a nice choice from a developer’s perspective.

## First steps
It was about selecting our online store Theme. I chose the Studio Theme, which was the cleanest one I saw, and I already have some vision in my mind on how to improve it.

I spent some time playing with the portal. It was my first experience with an e-commerce portal, and there are a lot of things I need to learn, but I’m looking forward to it!

When I had a demo page with a demo product ready, I tried to set up the payment methods. It took me a few hours to complete it because I was mainly stuck with Apple Pay methods, but then it somehow started working. I love those problems which are solved just by time :)

## Create local environment for build
I decided that would be good to switch from the Shopify portal to VSCode and try to make it more custom. So I can show a little bit of myself. And I enjoy making things prettier and user-friendly.

I installed Shopify CLI and Ruby on my machine and got the files from the Shopify portal. Then I connected Shopify with my GitHub account. So now I have a repo where I can push changes, and those changes can be reflected in my e-shop.

Mainly what I wanted to accomplish was to have a local environment and test the e-shop on my local machine. So I don’t need manual interaction with the portal to see my tests and changes.

## First code
Everything is written in .liquid. I was a little bit scared because I didn’t know what it was, but then I played with it one evening with my Claude AI fellow, and we made one feature already work.

Now on our e-shop, if a customer wants to select a language, they will get the option to choose between two languages - Czech and English.

The translation needs a couple more hours, but this step will be one of the last ones.
