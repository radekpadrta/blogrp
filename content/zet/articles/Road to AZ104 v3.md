### Few days before exam
For my last preparation, I reviewed John Savill's Study Cram which can be found here [Road to Azure v2](https://www.radekpadrta.cz/zet/articles/road-to-az104-v2/). And I did one test with 50-60 questions (about 1-2 hour for each) every day. Two days ago I got only 70% and the mood was not ok. I tested myself in my hometown when I visited my family so there was distraction to get the test done. I woke up early the next day before the test day and tried another exam and I got 92%, so it gave me some confidence. 

In the evening I watched the last 1 hour from Study cram and then I shut down my brain. I wanted to not think about the exam, just think about the present moment.

### Test day
I took the exam at 8AM so I woke up at 6AM, got a huge breakfast from my girlfriend, watched some YT videos, hit the toilet a few times and then I went to the exam. On the way to the test center I listened to some dopamine boost music. Then I hit the toilet one more time and here we go.

### The Two-Hour Challenge
The test was for two hours, when I sat at the computer I wasn't really nervous as I was supposed to be in the past. It's just a certification..

But after a few questions I was nervous. The certification was really tough! I got thoughts like: "When can I schedule the next attempt", "I am totally confused", "The time is ticking, no time".. and these thoughts made me nervous. 
In another way there was still the spirit in a different part of my head, that said, fuck it be logical and just read the question, don't think so much about the question and just try to make it.

The spirit was the correct one.

## We finished it!
After 2 hours I saw the result and there was PASS. I didn't say anything in my head. I just smiled at the monitor. We managed it and we beat it!

Some of these questions were really something I hadn't experienced. And that means there is huge room to improve my skills!
