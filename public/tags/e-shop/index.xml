      <description>Currency selector After we built a language selector, I also wanted a currency selector. It should be good to have the option to send packages anywhere, and people don’t want to see everything in Czech currency. We built markets in Shopify. I divided it into three pillars:
Czech Europe International Europe and International contain a few countries which I selected, just those where I saw potential.
When we set the markets, then I needed to send rates for shipping.</description>

After we built a language selector, I also wanted a currency selector. It should be good to have the option to send packages anywhere, and people don’t want to see everything in Czech currency. We built markets in Shopify. I divided it into three pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>Czech</li>
<li>Europe</li>
<li>International</li>
</ul>
<p>Europe and International contain a few countries which I selected, just those where I saw potential.</p>
<p>When we set the markets, then I needed to send rates for shipping. I put there just test prices; this needs more time to correctly set it.</p>
<p>And that setting gives me a pretty boring currency header. I wanted to have it better… It should be nice if users already understand -&gt; “here I can select currency for my country”.</p>
<p>Then I start tinkering with a code and I put an image of currency there, and in the wrapper, we can search countries! When you hover over a particular country, you will see the currency which will be shown on the page. But this is not all.. I already set geolocation, so if you are, for example, from Canada, you should see everything with Canadian currency. It should be automatic, but you know, it’s better to be prepared :)</p>
<p>Below the currency is me, just a demo photo from 9th grade from primary school :) And the scroll bar needs some tuning too!</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Then I started playing with the structure of the website. Here is the plan:</p>
<p>We will have two pillars of products. Each pillar has its own collections. And when you click the collections, you will see products of each collection. It’s maybe a lot for customers.. maybe you need to give them a lot of options that they can choose from on the main page.</p>
<p>This can be a good approach if you want to show everything in one check, but I also would like to have some system in our e-shop, and I think this will provide a better user experience for customers, to navigate a little bit and really find the treasure they are searching for.</p>

      <title>Shopify build v1 - language</title>

      <description>We are pushing our Home Business in these last days.
One of the things we need is an e-shop, and this is the task I’m taking care of. I was deciding between two e-commerce platforms. It was between Tilda and Shopify. The winner is Shopify, and it was a nice choice from a developer’s perspective.
First steps It was about selecting our online store Theme. I chose the Studio Theme, which was the cleanest one I saw, and I already have some vision in my mind on how to improve it.</description>

<h2 id="first-steps">First steps</h2>
<p>It was about selecting our online store Theme. I chose the Studio Theme, which was the cleanest one I saw, and I already have some vision in my mind on how to improve it.</p>
<p>I spent some time playing with the portal. It was my first experience with an e-commerce portal, and there are a lot of things I need to learn, but I’m looking forward to it!</p>
<p>When I had a demo page with a demo product ready, I tried to set up the payment methods. It took me a few hours to complete it because I was mainly stuck with Apple Pay methods, but then it somehow started working. I love those problems which are solved just by time :)</p>
<h2 id="create-local-environment-for-build">Create local environment for build</h2>
<p>I decided that would be good to switch from the Shopify portal to VSCode and try to make it more custom. So I can show a little bit of myself. And I enjoy making things prettier and user-friendly.</p>
<p>I installed Shopify CLI and Ruby on my machine and got the files from the Shopify portal. Then I connected Shopify with my GitHub account. So now I have a repo where I can push changes, and those changes can be reflected in my e-shop.</p>
<p>Mainly what I wanted to accomplish was to have a local environment and test the e-shop on my local machine. So I don’t need manual interaction with the portal to see my tests and changes.</p>
<h2 id="first-code">First code</h2>
<p>Everything is written in .liquid. I was a little bit scared because I didn’t know what it was, but then I played with it one evening with my Claude AI fellow, and we made one feature already work.</p>
<p>Now on our e-shop, if a customer wants to select a language, they will get the option to choose between two languages - Czech and English.</p>
<p>The translation needs a couple more hours, but this step will be one of the last ones.</p>
