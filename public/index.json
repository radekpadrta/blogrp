[{"content":"Few days before exam For my last preparation, I reviewed John Savill\u0026rsquo;s Study Cram which can be found here Road to Azure v2. And I did one test with 50-60 questions (about 1-2 hour for each) every day. Two days ago I got only 70% and the mood was not ok. I tested myself in my hometown when I visited my family so there was distraction to get the test done. I woke up early the next day before the test day and tried another exam and I got 92%, so it gave me some confidence.\nIn the evening I watched the last 1 hour from Study cram and then I shut down my brain. I wanted to not think about the exam, just think about the present moment.\nTest day I took the exam at 8AM so I woke up at 6AM, got a huge breakfast from my girlfriend, watched some YT videos, hit the toilet a few times and then I went to the exam. On the way to the test center I listened to some dopamine boost music. Then I hit the toilet one more time and here we go.\nThe Two-Hour Challenge The test was for two hours, when I sat at the computer I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really nervous as I was supposed to be in the past. It\u0026rsquo;s just a certification..\nBut after a few questions I was nervous. The certification was really tough! I got thoughts like: \u0026ldquo;When can I schedule the next attempt\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I am totally confused\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The time is ticking, no time\u0026rdquo;.. and these thoughts made me nervous. In another way there was still the spirit in a different part of my head, that said, fuck it be logical and just read the question, don\u0026rsquo;t think so much about the question and just try to make it.\nThe spirit was the correct one.\nWe finished it! After 2 hours I saw the result and there was PASS. I didn\u0026rsquo;t say anything in my head. I just smiled at the monitor. We managed it and we beat it!\nSome of these questions were really something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t experienced. And that means there is huge room to improve my skills!\nAnd here are these: Road to Azure v1 Road to Azure v2\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/road-to-az104-v3/","summary":"Few days before exam For my last preparation, I reviewed John Savill\u0026rsquo;s Study Cram which can be found here Road to Azure v2.

I want to watch it one more time.\nI need to mention, I don\u0026rsquo;t take many notes. I take notes only if I fail on some questions, but I do not take notes through the videos. This can be a problem, but I need to think positively before the test.

This is the result of my notes, where I tried to find a solution.\nEnvironment Variables On Azure web app, there is an option to use environment variables, but it is not a good approach if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to get alerts. The alerts can be created because your app will be restarted if you assign the variable. The app will be offline for some time. This means if you need to rewrite the variable in the future, you always need to restart the app. So this option was out because of the bigger web app, and we did not want to have it offline for some time.\nFeature Flags Another option was to use Feature flags in the App Configuration service. Feature flags are in the Feature manager in App Configuration. The feature flags can be called only through SDK; there is no REST API, and that was the problem. Because if you want to use SDK, you need to install some library, and in our case, it was nugets, and that was a no-go.\nSo how we can make the Feature flags work?\nKey Value The approach was to use Key Value which can be found in Configuration explorer.\nBut I found the authorization through REST API a little bit more complicated than usual. You need to get a Bearer token first and then reach the endpoint.\nAnd this is how you can get the token: POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/ad9ab3ca-16d5-496d-8591-b7f91a515135/oauth2/v2.0/token\rBody - x-www-form-urlencoded\rValues:\rclient_id:value\rclient_secret:value\rgrant_type:client_credentials\rscope:https://management.azure.com/.default Unfortunately, the Bearer token is a little bit complicated to get, and you need to use ClientID and Client Secret from your App Registration, and this is something that needs to be changed. But it is ok if you want this approach, you just need to store these values in Key Vault and reference the Key Vault in your code.\nAnd this is the URL how to get the endpoint for KeyValue (GET)\nhttps://management.azure.com/subscriptions/SubscriptionID/resourceGroups/RGname/providers/Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores/AppConfigurationName/keyValues/NameOfKeyValue$NameOfLabel?api-version=2023-03-01 Our approach is upgrade the solution to used managed identity to communicate with the App Configuration, but how we do that. This will be added later.\nPipeline This can be used in Pipeline if we need to use feature flags.\nIn the pipeline approach, this should work to get info about a Feature flag from Feature manager.\naz appconfig feature show -n NameOfTheAppConfiguration --key .appconfig.featureflag/NameOfTheFeatureFlag --subscription xxx ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/feature-flags/","summary":"This article is about finding a way how to create feature flags on a Web app or App configuration.

In the AI world, we wanted to have one place where we could build our AI solutions and we wanted to have platform where other developers could easily collaborate. And this is a great use case for Prompt Flow, which works as an orchestration tool for our builds.\nWe built two solutions. Our vision was to get metadata from some article and alternative text from pictures, and then each solution needed a final step: a translator to translate the results into different languages.\nAnd these two solutions were created through the Prompt Flow. Source code here\nWhen we built the solution through Prompt Flow, our next step was to create an endpoint where the solution could be hosted and wait for travelers (requests).\nHow Did We Do That? When we create builds on Prompt flow, we used the Machine Learning Workspace, which also has an option to create the endpoint. Creating the endpoint was a simple task, but how could we assign the Prompt Flow solution to the endpoint, right?\nWhere the Fun Begins The solution needs to be packaged first, and that the need for us to create a model in MLW. It means: Prompt Flow build become a Model. Once we have the model, we can create an empty endpoint, which will wait for our model. However, to complete this, we need to create an Environment.\nThe Environment for building our model needs to be somehow added to the endpoint, and the environment is something that will handle the deployment. If you remember from the start, I mentioned that our use case also needed a translator, right? This is a small problem for the environment because we can\u0026rsquo;t use a pre-built environment and we need to create our own.\nWhy? The translator isn\u0026rsquo;t included by default in Prompt Flow, but you can install packages in Prompt Flow. That is why you need to have the package also in your environment. We used a predefined image and we added the RUN command for the translator package. That is how we built the environment through Dockerfile and ACR. We hosted the Docker image in Azure Container Registry.\nOk, we have Prompt Flow (Builds) - Model - Endpoint (Empty) - Environment. So what is the next and the last step to push travelers(request) to the castle(endpoint) ?\nDeployment: Facing the Final Boss Deployment This is last boss who is waiting for us and need to be finished. Here we need to gather all the information about our previous road - model, environment, and the endpoint need to be entered to the deployment, but we also need to provide SKU (VM) and assign the traffic.\nThen if we get green light, the boss is finished and our castle can welcome travelers.\nMore about the project will be added soon.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/creating-and-hosting-an-ai-solution-using-prompt-flow/","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about why we chose the Prompt Flow.

Initially, I thought, \u0026ldquo;hell no,\u0026rdquo; because I can\u0026rsquo;t speak like a C1 English speaker, and I had never tried public speaking before.\nAfter the challenge from the team, my goals pinged my endpoint in my head and I saw an opportunity to grow a little bit there.\nCommunication is one of the most valuable skills for DevOps Engineers. We need to present our work, we need to clearly explain the issues, etc. This is something I am still working on, and it was not long before I realized this fact.\nWhat is the Mambo Jambo? - it is a platform for public speaking where anyone can join the presentation if is interested in the topic. The topics/talks are about Azure, AWS, Front-End, and .Net and they are organized every month by ACTUM Digital. Events are onsite in Prague.\nInformations about upcoming Mambo Jambo events -\u0026gt; follow this profile or check eventbrite\nSo I said yes, I will be presenting the solution that we create in our team.\nI had two weeks to prepare the presentation and I already had some ideas on how to do it. I wanted to have something different than PowerPoint. That tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit me I like some for tinkering. My first idea was to give a presentation just in the terminal, but I quickly realized that the audience would not be such nerdy :)\nI found an advanced slides plugin in Obsidian and I decided to give it a try. I spent a few evenings building the presentation. After I built the presentation I created a static web app in Azure and I connected the web app to my custom domain.\nAt Mambo Jambo, everyone had the opportunity to open the presentation on their mobile phones. And this was something where I saw the next opportunity. If people are interested in the topic, they can click on GitHub or LinkedIn to learn more about it or about me. This was why I decided to host the presentation on my domain.\nMambo Jambo Night With my girlfriend, we did three dry runs and also one online dry run with my brother. Which gives me some confidence.\nStill, I was nervous but in a really nice way and that way pushed me to stand in front of the people.. I always try to keep a positive mind in challenging events it helps me and also the team. I remember just one sentence that I said before the presentation. \u0026ldquo;If I don\u0026rsquo;t poop myself in front of the people, then no worries.\u0026rdquo; So always go to the toilet before))\nThe presentation went well, but there is so much space to improve myself, the speak, etc.\nFor the first time, I think it was ok. It can be always better and we always see the improvements in ourselves. If you do not see any, try to take feedback from others.\nIn the end, I am proud of myself for finding the courage. I was also really happy and grateful that a lot of friends came to check out my speech. Their presence gave me the power I needed to stand before the people.\nAs I mentioned, this was a new experience for me, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it will be the last.\nI enjoyed it!\nThe presentation is done, let\u0026rsquo;s move now to the certification.
