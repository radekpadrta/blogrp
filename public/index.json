There were a few changes in the last week, one of them being about my job. I decided to accept a new job offer, which means there will be a lot of new opportunities to learn in few weeks. From job interviews and some of my own research, I feel like it was a good decision, and I believe it will have also a huge impact on my journey as the current job!\nHome business The second thing is about our home business. We have finished all the prep, we made a strategy, and now we are going all in. It requires some investments from our side, mainly time, which is the most valuable thing for us, but we believe it is something we can do over the next 10 years as a hobby. So LFG :)\nOnline Presence The third thing is about online presence. It means being more active from my side in sharing on social media. I chose LinkedIn, which is also a good place to share my journey, and I will start posting on Instagram. I have a small idea about the content, but this will need to wait for a few days until I am back home.\nIn the meantime, you can see a few pictures from Madeira and more on my Instagram, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to connect with me there.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it.\r","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/reflection-on-madeira/","summary":"We are in Madeira, our fifth day here.

We need to create the web app with an environment that will be short-lived, allowing someone to test the app within short time period.\nWe want to automate the process, and one way to do that is to build the solution through a Pull Request.\nWhy through Pull Request? Imagine you created an application or just some feature in your app. You don‚Äôt want to push it to the production environment, but rather to a short-lived environment, to ensure that everything is okay and to decide if you can merge the PR request, for example, to the main branch. The short-lived environment provides us with a space to test the application.\nHow it works? A user on GitHub will open a Pull Request. They will then choose which application they want to build (remember, we have multiple applications/features in one repository). The user selects the option they want to build, for example, Variant2.\nHow can the user choose which app? In the PR, there are labels. We have created a label named Variant2. If the user selects this label and opens the PR, it will trigger the pipeline, and many things will be triggered. We will discuss this in more detail later, but first, let‚Äôs talk about our possibilities.\nWhat are our options? There are three types I\u0026rsquo;m working on. There may be more options, and I would be really glad to hear your thoughts about it.\nOur case: We have code in GitHub. My testing includes the following:\nWeb App - Azure DevOps Static Web App - Azure DevOps Static Web App - GitHub Actions Let\u0026rsquo;s discuss each, how it works at a high level, and the pros and cons.\nWeb App - Azure DevOps We opened the PR. We didn\u0026rsquo;t select a label. Should the pipeline be triggered? No. Why is it not triggered? Because we are using a webhook, and we defined what will trigger it. In our case, it is when a label is added.\nYou might be wondering, what if we select a different label? For this, we have a pipeline with many conditions that check what is needed and what is already set.\nHere is a visualization of the flow. I will not dive into the solution, or I would be writing about it for hours. The solution is in azure-pipelines-pr-open.yml. You can check it there and you will find other pipeline there.\nWhat is cool about this solution? You can manage everything and have full control over your build. You can trigger comments for your developers, letting them know what is happening in the pipeline while they wait for the short-lived environment. It‚Äôs a flexible solution and, in my opinion, this approach is best for larger applications because it allows you to simulate everything needed in Azure. We are not just creating the Web App, we are also creating the container image, setting policies, and managing RBAC for each Web App. No need to use any tokens\u0026hellip;everything is done through CLI and managed identity.\nWhat is bad? You need to pay for the service plan, create additional components, and the pipeline can become larger and harder to maintain with changes. You also need to implement lifecycle management. If you want to use a web app, you need to create a container for your code and wait for boot-up until your app is ready. Typically, this takes about 6-9 minutes, even when using very basic code.\nStatic Web App - Azure DevOps The trigger is the same as above. We are using a Static Web App, which means we don‚Äôt need as much in the pipeline as for a Web App. All we need is the Static Web App.\nWhat is cool? You can create preview environments and configure them as needed. For example, you can create two or three apps in one PR by selecting two or three labels, and it is cheaper than using a Web App.\nWhat is bad? It is similarly challenging to set up as a Web App and hard to maintain if there are changes.\nStatic Web App - GitHub Actions You need to set up the connection between the Static Web App and GitHub. You can follow this guide to do that: How to conenct SWA with GitHub\nOnce you set the connection, a pipeline for GitHub Actions will be automatically created in your repository.\nThis automatically created pipeline is not ideal for our use case, but if we make it prettier, it can be very useful!\nThe udpated pipeline can be found here\nWe don‚Äôt need to worry about webhooks or payloads, and we don‚Äôt use any conditions. Everything is handled in a different way, which we don\u0026rsquo;t see.\nThe only things we need to configure is how to get the URL of the preview environment and how to choose which app we want to build.\nWhat is cool? If the code is in GitHub, it‚Äôs easy to set up Actions, understand, and maintain. One PR = One App. I working now on how to make it more flexible, so hopefully, in the next post, there will be some progress. But overall, it\u0026rsquo;s best solution.\nWhat is bad? We don‚Äôt work with the payload, making it difficult to create flexible tasks. Additionally, we don‚Äôt see what is happening in GitHub Actions, for example when it sends information to users.\nConclusion If you have a lot of time, want to be sure everything is set up according to your needs, and you have money, go for the Web App.\nIf you have some time, and already Azure set for your Web App environments, and want to test the solution and discard it without incurring high costs, choose the Static Web App.\nIf you want an easy solution, don‚Äôt want to spend much time on it, and don‚Äôt need a highly flexible setup, go with the Static Web App using GitHub Actions.\nLINKS: 16-08-2024-08:49\n[[]]\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/pr-automation/","summary":"We have a couple of codes in one repository, each creates a web application.

No need to come to a Developer and say we need this and the developer will spend time to prepare the thing. The Web App should be like a template for users.\nI have prepared an environment which needs to be built if the solution is needed. So imagine Franta Flinta needs a web app which can be shown in a presentation.\nHe will come to GitHub and he will create a PR request. He puts a label \u0026ldquo;Create Environment\u0026rdquo; there and the magic starts.\nPipeline Workflow Choosing the label \u0026ldquo;Create Environment\u0026rdquo;, triggers the pipeline.

If you unlabeled the label or close the PR, there is another Pipeline which destroys everything that was built.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re now thinking how the user will get the address back to the GitHub repo? We are using just webhooks and the webhook payload can be accessed in the Pipeline. So we are checking the number.\nThe number references the issue/PR and then we know where we need to send the comments. So after correct steps we always inform the user about the process of the solution.\nSolution Improvements? Yes, there are, and these are everywhere.\nWhat I want to do is to create an action to check how long the Web App has been up, so we can remove it after a certain time period and save money. Also, there can be some field in the PR which can be extracted in the Pipeline, and the Pipeline will assign the variable into the Code.

And I did one test with 50-60 questions (about 1-2 hour for each) every day. Two days ago I got only 70% and the mood was not ok. I tested myself in my hometown when I visited my family so there was distraction to get the test done. I woke up early the next day before the test day and tried another exam and I got 92%, so it gave me some confidence.\nIn the evening I watched the last 1 hour from Study cram and then I shut down my brain. I wanted to not think about the exam, just think about the present moment.\nTest day I took the exam at 8AM so I woke up at 6AM, got a huge breakfast from my girlfriend, watched some YT videos, hit the toilet a few times and then I went to the exam.

Then I hit the toilet one more time and here we go.\nThe Two-Hour Challenge The test was for two hours, when I sat at the computer I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really nervous as I was supposed to be in the past.

This is the result of my notes, where I tried to find a solution.\nEnvironment Variables On Azure web app, there is an option to use environment variables, but it is not a good approach if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to get alerts. The alerts can be created because your app will be restarted if you assign the variable. The app will be offline for some time. This means if you need to rewrite the variable in the future, you always need to restart the app. So this option was out because of the bigger web app, and we did not want to have it offline for some time.\nFeature Flags Another option was to use Feature flags in the App Configuration service. Feature flags are in the Feature manager in App Configuration. The feature flags can be called only through SDK; there is no REST API, and that was the problem. Because if you want to use SDK, you need to install some library, and in our case, it was nugets, and that was a no-go.\nSo how we can make the Feature flags work?\nKey Value The approach was to use Key Value which can be found in Configuration explorer.\nBut I found the authorization through REST API a little bit more complicated than usual. You need to get a Bearer token first and then reach the endpoint.\nAnd this is how you can get the token: POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/ad9ab3ca-16d5-496d-8591-b7f91a515135/oauth2/v2.0/token\rBody - x-www-form-urlencoded\rValues:\rclient_id:value\rclient_secret:value\rgrant_type:client_credentials\rscope:https://management.azure.com/.default Unfortunately, the Bearer token is a little bit complicated to get, and you need to use ClientID and Client Secret from your App Registration, and this is something that needs to be changed. But it is ok if you want this approach, you just need to store these values in Key Vault and reference the Key Vault in your code.\nAnd this is the URL how to get the endpoint for KeyValue (GET)\nhttps://management.azure.com/subscriptions/SubscriptionID/resourceGroups/RGname/providers/Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores/AppConfigurationName/keyValues/NameOfKeyValue$NameOfLabel?api-version=2023-03-01 Our approach is upgrade the solution to used managed identity to communicate with the App Configuration, but how we do that. This will be added later.\nPipeline This can be used in Pipeline if we need to use feature flags.\nIn the pipeline approach, this should work to get info about a Feature flag from Feature manager.\naz appconfig feature show -n NameOfTheAppConfiguration --key .appconfig.featureflag/NameOfTheFeatureFlag --subscription xxx ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/feature-flags/","summary":"This article is about finding a way how to create feature flags on a Web app or App configuration.

In the AI world, we wanted to have one place where we could build our AI solutions and we wanted to have platform where other developers could easily collaborate. And this is a great use case for Prompt Flow, which works as an orchestration tool for our builds.\nWe built two solutions. Our vision was to get metadata from some article and alternative text from pictures, and then each solution needed a final step: a translator to translate the results into different languages.\nAnd these two solutions were created through the Prompt Flow. Source code here\nWhen we built the solution through Prompt Flow, our next step was to create an endpoint where the solution could be hosted and wait for travelers (requests).\nHow Did We Do That? When we create builds on Prompt flow, we used the Machine Learning Workspace, which also has an option to create the endpoint. Creating the endpoint was a simple task, but how could we assign the Prompt Flow solution to the endpoint, right?\nWhere the Fun Begins The solution needs to be packaged first, and that the need for us to create a model in MLW. It means: Prompt Flow build become a Model. Once we have the model, we can create an empty endpoint, which will wait for our model. However, to complete this, we need to create an Environment.\nThe Environment for building our model needs to be somehow added to the endpoint, and the environment is something that will handle the deployment. If you remember from the start, I mentioned that our use case also needed a translator, right? This is a small problem for the environment because we can\u0026rsquo;t use a pre-built environment and we need to create our own.\nWhy? The translator isn\u0026rsquo;t included by default in Prompt Flow, but you can install packages in Prompt Flow. That is why you need to have the package also in your environment. We used a predefined image and we added the RUN command for the translator package. That is how we built the environment through Dockerfile and ACR. We hosted the Docker image in Azure Container Registry.\nOk, we have Prompt Flow (Builds) - Model - Endpoint (Empty) - Environment. So what is the next and the last step to push travelers(request) to the castle(endpoint) ?\nDeployment: Facing the Final Boss Deployment This is last boss who is waiting for us and need to be finished. Here we need to gather all the information about our previous road - model, environment, and the endpoint need to be entered to the deployment, but we also need to provide SKU (VM) and assign the traffic.\nThen if we get green light, the boss is finished and our castle can welcome travelers.\nMore about the project will be added soon.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/creating-and-hosting-an-ai-solution-using-prompt-flow/","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about why we chose the Prompt Flow.
