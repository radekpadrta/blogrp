[{"content":"Creating and Hosting an AI Solution Using Prompt Flow Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about why we chose the Prompt Flow. In the AI world, we wanted to have one place where we could build our AI solutions and we wanted to have platform where other developers could easily collaborate. And this is a great use case for Prompt Flow, which works as an orchestration tool for our builds.\nWe built two solutions. Our vision was to get metadata from some article and alternative text from pictures, and then each solution needed a final step: a translator to translate the results into different languages.\nAnd these two solutions were created through the Prompt Flow. Source code here\nWhen we built the solution through Prompt Flow, our next step was to create an endpoint where the solution could be hosted and wait for travelers (requests).\nHow Did We Do That? When we create builds on Prompt flow, we used the Machine Learning Workspace, which also has an option to create the endpoint. Creating the endpoint was a simple task, but how could we assign the Prompt Flow solution to the endpoint, right?\nWhere the Fun Begins The solution needs to be packaged first, and that the need for us to create a model in MLW. It means: Prompt Flow build become a Model. Once we have the model, we can create an empty endpoint, which will wait for our model. However, to complete this, we need to create an Environment.\nThe Environment for building our model needs to be somehow added to the endpoint, and the environment is something that will handle the deployment. If you remember from the start, I mentioned that our use case also needed a translator, right? This is a small problem for the environment because we can\u0026rsquo;t use a pre-built environment and we need to create our own.\nWhy? The translator isn\u0026rsquo;t included by default in Prompt Flow, but you can install packages in Prompt Flow. That is why you need to have the package also in your environment. We used a predefined image and we added the RUN command for the translator package. That is how we built the environment through Dockerfile and ACR. We hosted the Docker image in Azure Container Registry.\nOk, we have Prompt Flow (Builds) -\u0026gt; Model -\u0026gt; Endpoint (Empty) -\u0026gt; Environment. So what is the next and the last step to push travelers(request) to the castle(endpoint) ?\nDeployment: Facing the Final Boss Deployment This is last boss who is waiting for us and need to be finished. Here we need to gather all the information about our previous road -\u0026gt; model, environment, and the endpoint need to be entered to the deployment, but we also need to provide SKU (VM) and assign the traffic.\nThen if we get green light, the boss is finished and our castle can welcome travelers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/creating-and-hosting-an-ai-solution-using-prompt-flow/","summary":"Creating and Hosting an AI Solution Using Prompt Flow Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about why we chose the Prompt Flow.

As a Cloud Engineer who mainly works with Azure, this certification is one of the must-haves.\nI made it as my main quest for this month to push myself and stay committed, I already scheduled the onsite exam for July 29th at 8 AM. I believe that early time is the best for me to be sharp and this gives me 25 days to prepare. It\u0026rsquo;s not much time to prepare. If you have full time job and energetic girlfriend.\nMy study plan My study plan is a bit different from others certifications. I want to focus mainly on practice exams and analyze the areas where I failed during the exams. This should help me better understand the topics where I am weak, allowing me to skip over the things that don\u0026rsquo;t need much improvement.\nFirst Practice Exam Attempt I made my first attempt today on the Azure portal and scored only 44%.\nHowever, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad about it. Scoring 44% on the first attempt is good, and I realized that I was just making some dumb mistakes and I was a bit hurry. Looking forward to next improvements.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/road-to-az104/","summary":"I started to prepare for a new certification, AZ-104.

Initially, I thought, \u0026ldquo;hell no,\u0026rdquo; because I can\u0026rsquo;t speak like a C1 English speaker, and I had never tried public speaking before.\nAfter the challenge from the team, my goals pinged my endpoint in my head and I saw an opportunity to grow a little bit there.\nCommunication is one of the most valuable skills for DevOps Engineers. We need to present our work, we need to clearly explain the issues, etc. This is something I am still working on, and it was not long before I realized this fact.\nWhat is the Mambo Jambo? - it is a platform for public speaking where anyone can join the presentation if is interested in the topic. The topics/talks are about Azure, AWS, Front-End, and .Net and they are organized every month by ACTUM Digital. Events are onsite in Prague.\nInformations about upcoming Mambo Jambo events -\u0026gt; follow this profile or check eventbrite\nSo I said yes, I will be presenting the solution that we create in our team.\nI had two weeks to prepare the presentation and I already had some ideas on how to do it. I wanted to have something different than PowerPoint. That tool doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit me I like some for tinkering. My first idea was to give a presentation just in the terminal, but I quickly realized that the audience would not be such nerdy :)\nI found an advanced slides plugin in Obsidian and I decided to give it a try. I spent a few evenings building the presentation. After I built the presentation I created a static web app in Azure and I connected the web app to my custom domain.\nAt Mambo Jambo, everyone had the opportunity to open the presentation on their mobile phones. And this was something where I saw the next opportunity. If people are interested in the topic, they can click on GitHub or LinkedIn to learn more about it or about me. This was why I decided to host the presentation on my domain.\nMambo Jambo Night With my girlfriend, we did three dry runs and also one online dry run with my brother. Which gives me some confidence.\nStill, I was nervous but in a really nice way and that way pushed me to stand in front of the people.. I always try to keep a positive mind in challenging events it helps me and also the team. I remember just one sentence that I said before the presentation. \u0026ldquo;If I don\u0026rsquo;t poop myself in front of the people, then no worries.\u0026rdquo; So always go to the toilet before))\nThe presentation went well, but there is so much space to improve myself, the speak, etc.\nFor the first time, I think it was ok. It can be always better and we always see the improvements in ourselves. If you do not see any, try to take feedback from others.\nIn the end, I am proud of myself for finding the courage. I was also really happy and grateful that a lot of friends came to check out my speech. Their presence gave me the power I needed to stand before the people.\nAs I mentioned, this was a new experience for me, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it will be the last.\nI enjoyed it!\nThe presentation is done, let\u0026rsquo;s move now to the certification. Certification progress is something that I would like to write next time.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zet/articles/public-speaking-mambo-jambo/","summary":"I worked on new things in my new job when we built a solution -\u0026gt; In a high-level overview, we built an end-to-end solution and created an automated orchestration service for our AI builds.\nI presented the documentation and the solution in our meetings, and the guys from my team told me that I should present this at Mambo Jambo.
